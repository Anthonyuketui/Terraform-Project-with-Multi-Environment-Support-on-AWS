# Production-Ready Terraform Project with Multi-Environment Support

This repository contains a **production-ready AWS infrastructure** setup using Terraform, designed to support multiple environments (`dev` and `prod`). The infrastructure is modular, secure, and scalable with monitoring and auto-scaling capabilities.

---

## Features

- **Multi-environment support**: Separate configurations for `dev` and `prod`.
- **Modular design**: Reusable Terraform modules for VPC, ALB, EC2, RDS, and monitoring.
- **Auto Scaling**: EC2 Auto Scaling Group adjusts capacity based on CPU utilization.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes traffic to private EC2 instances.
- **RDS Database**: Secure MySQL database with credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager.
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: CloudWatch alarms with SNS email notifications for EC2, ALB, and RDS.
- **Secure networking**: Public and private subnets, security groups, and proper routing.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform 1.5+](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- AWS account with permissions for:
  - VPC, Subnets, Route Tables
  - EC2, Security Groups, ALB
  - RDS, Secrets Manager
  - CloudWatch, SNS

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-multi-env.git
cd terraform-multi-env
````

### 2. Deploy the Dev Environment

```bash
cd environments/dev
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

### 3. Deploy the Prod Environment

```bash
cd ../prod
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

## Module Overview

### VPC

* Creates VPC, public & private subnets
* Configures IGW + NAT Gateway
* Private subnets for EC2 & RDS

### ALB

* Internet-facing ALB in public subnets
* Routes traffic to EC2 in private subnets
* Health checks configurable

### EC2

* Launch Template + Auto Scaling Group
* User-data bootstraps web server
* Scaling policies: CPU thresholds
* CloudWatch alarms integrated

### RDS

* MySQL database in private subnet
* Credentials stored in Secrets Manager
* Configurable instance size

### Monitoring

* CloudWatch alarms for:

  * ASG CPU utilization
  * RDS CPU/storage
  * ALB target group health
* Alerts via SNS (email)

## Example `terraform.tfvars`

### Dev

```hcl
environment        = "dev"
region             = "us-east-1"
instance_type      = "t3.micro"
desired_capacity   = 1
db_instance_class  = "db.t3.micro"
alert_emails       = ["youremail@example.com"]
```

### Prod

```hcl
environment        = "prod"
region             = "us-east-1"
instance_type      = "t3.medium"
desired_capacity   = 2
db_instance_class  = "db.t3.medium"
alert_emails       = ["alerts@example.com"]
```

## Security Considerations

* Private subnets for EC2 & RDS
* DB credentials managed with Secrets Manager
* Security groups:

  * ALB: allows HTTP/HTTPS from the internet
  * EC2: allows traffic only from ALB
  * RDS: allows traffic only from EC2

---

## Troubleshooting

* **ASG not registering in ALB?**

  * Check EC2 health checks
  * Verify security group rules

* **CloudWatch alarms not triggering?**

  * Ensure correct ASG name & scaling policy ARNs passed to monitoring module

⚡ Now it’s fully structured in Markdown — heading hierarchy, code blocks, and lists are all GitHub-ready.  

Want me to also add a **diagram section** (with `![architecture diagram](docs/diagram.png)`) so that when you generate/upload a diagram later, it will render automatically on GitHub?
